      <h2><a href="/courses/meaning-as-use">Meaning as Use: Indexicality, Expressives, and Self-Reference</a></h2>

<h3>Room: UTC 4.104</h3>


<h4>Description</h4>
<p><p>The slogan 'meaning is use', usually attributed to Wittgenstein,
  captures the insight that for many expressions of natural language,
  semantic theory should state rules of use rather than-- or in addition
  to-- specifying the concept or logical translation associated with the
  expression.   This workshop aims to explore current and evolving ideas
  about this use-dependent aspect of language and its connections with
  other domains.  For indexicals such as 'I', 'you', and 'now', "the
  referent is dependent on the context of use and the word provides a
  rule which determines the referent in terms of certain aspects of the
  context" (Kaplan).  Self-reference is a special case of indexicality
  that presents its own set of puzzles (Kamp, Anand), and also bears
  connections to expressive content and evidentials. Expressives like
  'damn' and 'bastard' convey important affective content in a special
  way that differs from the presentation of descriptive content (Potts).
   Evidential markers indicate the source or nature of the evidence for
  the information in a sentence in a way that is closely tied to
  self-ascription (McCready, Murray).  In this workshop we explore a
  variety of topics and the connections between them, with presentations
  and discussion by leading contributors to this field.</p>

  this workshop, as laid out in the general workshop description above.
  Then we will focus on some specific issues of current interest:
  self-ascription in conjunct/disjunct systems, where verbs in first
  person declaratives or second person interrogatives bear a special
  marking; underspecified emotive content and how it is interpreted; and
  evidential marking.</p>

  generally involves an ‘indexical’ singular term ‘n’, which represents
  the ‘psychological present’, and (ii) that when the thought is a
  self-ascription (a ‘thought de se’), its representation also involves
  an ‘indexical’ singular term ‘i’, representing the self.
<p>The occurrence of ‘i’ in the representation of a thought that a
  speaker wants to express in words licenses her use of the first person
  pronoun ‘I’; but her use of ‘I’ will produce in her addressee the
  representation of a de re ascription to her. (‘you’ produces
  discrepancies of the opposite kind; its use is licensed when the
  speaker puts a thought into words that is a de re ascription to the
  addressee, but will provoke the addressee into constructing the
  representation of a self-ascription.)
<p>In a somewhat analogous way, the presence of ‘n’ in the mental
  representation of a speaker guides her choice of tenses and temporal
  adverbs, but the temporal information carried by these sentence
  elements can be reconverted to the same representational form that
  gave rise to them: speaker and addressee share their psychological
  present (at least in face-to-face conversation) and can represent it
  using the same forms.
<p>The interactions between the mental indexicals ‘i’ and ‘n’ on the one
  hand and the linguistic indexicals ‘I’, ‘you’ and the tenses and
  temporal adverbials on the other merit careful scrutiny. This is true
  in particular when the thoughts that are being communicated between
  speaker and addressee involve nested attitude attributions – as when
  the speaker thinks, and ventures to say to the addressee, that she
  thinks that he does not like her.
<p>The talk will present the forms of the representations, discuss the
  ways in which these representations can be converted into words and in
  which those words can in their turn be reconverted into mental
  representations by the recipient, with special attention to the nested
  embeddings mentioned above.

For example, Berkeley (1710) and Nagel (1974) asked whether there are limits to our imaginative capacities and Williams (1973) asked if such imagistic experiences have an explicit 'perspective' or 'self' that orients the perception or pseudo-perception.</p> <p>A linguistic question that arises is whether such perspectival information affects the truth conditions of ascriptions of memory and imagination. Vendler (1982) and Higginbotham (2003) explicitly say yes, focusing on examples with and without PRO, such as Vendler's 'I imagined swimming in the ocean' and 'I imagined myself swimming in the ocean'.</p> <p>In this talk, I will argue that whatever perspectival distinctions we may wish to make in imagistic attitudes, they do not map cleanly onto obligatorily de se attitudes. Rather, I will argue that perspective arises either from the context-dependent nature of the expressions in question or constraints that imagistic experiences themselves bring to the table.</p> <h4><a href="/files/courses/anand-slides.pdf">Slides</a></h4> <h4>Readings</h4> <ul> <li><a href="https://sites.google.com/site/2011personindexicals/documen/Anand-2011.pdf">Anand, Pranav. 2011.

Based on this comparison, I argue that there are two kinds of indexical expressions found in natural language: pure indexicals and anaphoric indexicals. Pure indexicals, after Kaplan 1978, are exemplified by first person pronouns in English and Cheyenne (Algonquian: Montana). Anaphoric indexicals are exemplified by the reportative evidential in Cheyenne, roughly similar to the evidential adverb reportedly in English. Like the first person pronouns, both the Cheyenne reportative and English reportedly are anchored to the speaker in declarative sentences, discourse initially and discourse internally.  For all of them, a change in the speaker affects the content of the sentence. However, in questions, the Cheyenne reportative and English reportedly are anchored to the addressee, unlike the first person pronouns. Examples such as evidentials in questions show that despite the strong similarities between first person pronouns and evidentials, they cannot be represented in exactly the same way. At the same time, their strong overlap must be accounted for. <p>This talk will also present an analysis of these two different kinds of indexicals where pure indexicals are analyzed a la Kaplan 1978 as referring to the context of utterance, represented by the speech event. The first person pronoun, for example, refers to the agent of the speech event. Anaphoric indexicals are analyzed as referring to the currently topical event. By default, in unembedded, declarative cases, the currently topical event is the speech event, the agent of which is the speaker. However, the topical event can change, depending on particular constructions in particular languages, yielding a restricted set of other individuals that the anaphoric indexicals can refer to. A formalization of this analysis is given in an update semantics with sequence based anaphora. This analysis accounts for the fact that by default anaphoric indexicals and pure indexicals refer to the same individuals. However, in questions or embedded cases, when the topical event changes, they refer to different individuals. In addition, this analysis accounts for the fact that Cheyenne reportatives are limited to secondhand reports. <h4>Readings:</h4> <ul> <li>Murray, Sarah. 2010. <a href="http://conf.ling.cornell.edu/sem/Evidentials-and-Questions-in-Cheyenne.pdf">Evidentials and Questions in Cheyenne.</a> In Suzi Lima (ed.), Proceedings of SULA 5: Semantics of Under-Represented Languages in the Americas.

    markers of solidarity and shared sentiment, and that they can in turn
    be used to foster, reinforce, or tacitly insist upon a sense of common
    ground between a speaker and her audience.  We will present
    quantitative corpus evidence that these affective uses are prevalent
    and robust, not only in English, but also in German and Japanese, and
    that similar effects are found with personal pronouns.  The question
    then arises of where these affective, social meanings come from.  Do
    they represent a semantic ambiguity, or can they be derived
    pragmatically?  We will argue for a pragmatic approach.  Specifically,
    we will seek to show that affective uses of this sort are expected on
    the theory of Elbourne (2008), in which both personal pronouns and
    demonstratives require the speaker and hearer to coordinate on
    contextually supplied properties and referential indices.  These
    requirements draw on, and hence evoke the common ground that exists
    between speaker and hearer.
